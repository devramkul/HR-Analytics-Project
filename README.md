# HR-Analytics-Project

# Project Overview
The HR Analytics Project is a data analysis project that aims to provide insights into HR data using Power BI and MySQL. It utilizes a dataset stored in a MySQL database and visualizes the findings through a Power BI dashboard. By combining these technologies, the project demonstrates the integration of data analytics and visualization for HR purposes.

# Aim
The aim of the HR Analytics Project is to leverage the combined power of MySQL and Power BI to provide a comprehensive analysis of HR-related data. This project seeks to offer actionable insights into various HR aspects, such as employee performance, satisfaction, and other relevant metrics, in a user-friendly and visually engaging manner.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in a MySQL database. It consists of HR-related data such as employee information, performance metrics, and employee satisfaction surveys. The dataset is essential for performing various analyses and generating meaningful visualizations in the Power BI dashboard.

# Files Included
The project includes the following files:

HR_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix: This Power BI file contains the pre-built dashboard that visualizes the HR data. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore and analyze the dataset effectively.

dataset.sql: This SQL script file contains the necessary commands to create the HR dataset in a MySQL database. It includes table structures and sample data to populate the tables for analysis.

queries.sql: This SQL script file contains sample queries that can be executed in MySQL to perform data analysis and verification. These queries can help users gain deeper insights into the HR dataset and cross-verify the information presented in the Power BI dashboard.

# Challenges
Faced challenges when cross-verifying SQL queries with Power BI and when customizing complex SQL queries within the Power BI dashboard. These challenges can include ensuring that the data retrieved in SQL matches the data displayed in the dashboard, optimizing query performance, and designing the dashboard to effectively accommodate complex data transformations and custom queries. These challenges require careful coordination between your SQL database and Power BI development teams to ensure data consistency and a seamless user experience.
